In GeoGebra you can write formulas as well. To do so, check the box LaTeX formula in the dialog window of the
image:24px-Mode_text.svg.png[Mode text.svg,width=24,height=24] xref:/tools/Text.adoc[Text Tool] and enter your formula
in LaTeX syntax.

[NOTE]
====

In order to create text that contains a LaTeX formula as well as text you may enter the text inside \text{}, while
_LaTex Formula_ is activated.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++\text{The length of the diagonal is } \sqrt{ 2 }++`

====

[NOTE]
====

You can also use the xref:/commands/FormulaText.adoc[FormulaText Command] to enter your formula within quotes.

====

[EXAMPLE]
====

`++FormulaText["\text{The length of the diagonal is } \sqrt{ 2 }"]++`

====

[NOTE]
====

You can simply obtain a LaTeX text containing the value of an object listed in the
image:16px-Menu_view_algebra.svg.png[Menu view algebra.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Algebra_View.adoc[Algebra View] by
dragging that object in the image:16px-Menu_view_algebra.svg.png[Menu view algebra.svg,width=16,height=16] _Algebra
View_ and dropping it in a selected location of the image:16px-Menu_view_graphics.svg.png[Menu view
graphics.svg,width=16,height=16] xref:/Graphics_View.adoc[Graphics View] .

====

You can find the syntax for common formula symbols from the drop-down menu next to the LaTeX checkbox (GeoGebra Desktop
Version) or in the _Advanced_ menu below the input field (GeoGebra Web and Tablet Apps Version). This inserts the
corresponding LaTeX code into the text field and places the cursor in between a set of curly brackets. The Symbols
drop-down menu contains a list of common math symbols, Greek letters and operators. If you would like to create dynamic
text within the formula, you need to select the relating objects from the image:16px-GeoGebra_48.png[GeoGebra
48.png,width=16,height=16] Objects drop-down list, causing GeoGebra to insert their names as well as the syntax for
mixed text.

Some important LaTeX commands are explained in following table. Please have a look at any LaTeX documentation for
further information.

[cols=",",options="header",]
|===
|LaTeX input |Result
|a \cdot b |stem:[a \cdot b]
|\frac{a}{b} |stem:[\frac{a}{b}]
|\sqrt{x} |stem:[\sqrt{x}]
|\sqrt[n]{x} |stem:[++\sqrt[n]{x}++]
|\vec{v} |stem:[\vec{v}]
|\overline{AB} |stem:[\overline{AB}]
|x^{2} |stem:[x^{2}]
|a_{1} |stem:[a_{1}]
|\sin\alpha + \cos\beta |stem:[\sin\alpha + \cos\beta]
|\int_{a}^{b} x dx |stem:[\int_{a}^{b} x dx]
|\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 |stem:[\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2]
|===

It is also possible to enter nicely formatted chemical formulas, using syntaxes
`++\ce, \mathchoice, \mskip, \lower, \raise, \mkern++`.
